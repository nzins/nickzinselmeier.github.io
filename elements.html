									<h1>Personal Statement
									</h1>
								</header>
									<header>
										<h2>Objective</h2>
										<p>My professional goals</p>
									</header>
									<p>I am passionate about data analytics, and finding insights through data which help companies achieve their goals and vision. I am currently seeking a data analyst position that would allow me to contribute to a company's data reporting department and analytics operations.
									</p>
									<p>I am also currently working towards achieving several certifications related to data analytics. In the near future, I am planning to complete certifications in: Tableau, R programming, Oracle, Python/Pyspark, Power BI, AWS.
									</p>
									<header>
										<h2>Where I have found success</h2>
										<p>Past accomplishments</p>
									</header>
									<p>In my previous internship experiences, I have been able to positively contribute to technical and strategic operations in both companies where I interned.
									</p>
									<p>At Kelley Blue Book, I learned how to complete tasks in their Order Entry System in just under a month, as well as contribute to the reorganization of their Ad Tagging system, which involved heavy usage of spreadsheets and understanding of complex naming conventions.
									</p>
									<p>At Nearcut, I was able to assist in the creation of a Facebook marketing campaign for the company. This involved both effective understanding of their brand strategies, as well as technical understanding of Facebook's ad manager program and experience with Excel to perform analysis on campaign data week by week.
									</p>

									<p>Beyond my internships, I have been successful in my undergraduate and graduate programs. I have since continued my education after graduation by completing certifications that have deepened my knowledge and skills as a data analyst.

										<h2>Some info about myself!</h2>
										<p>My interests and hobbies</p>
									</header>
									<header>
										<h3>Music</h3>
									</header>
									<p>I have been making my own music as a hobby for about 10 years beginning in high school. I love everything about the process, from inspiration based on what other composers are doing, to learning about new techniques, and the ever constant process of learning how to achieve a particular result given the tools at your disposal. I really enjoy watching youtube video essays from musicians who break down techniques that artists have used in the past to achieve a certain sound.
									</p>
									<p>I have played a handful of instruments in the past, but the one I most consistently play and practice with is the keyboard piano. Recently I've been very inspired by film and OST composers. I've taken masterclasses on this particular topic to learn more about well-known composers' creative processes like Hanz Zimmer and Danny Elfman.
									<header>
										<h3>Language & Travel</h3>
									</header>
									<p>I have enjoyed learning new languages in the past, including Spanish and German. I hope to improve my proficiency in German in particular, as my family has close ties to another family currently living in Germany. Eventually, it would be great to fluently speak German, and I view this as a personal long term goal. I would like to learn sign language at some point in the future as well.

									</figure2>
									<p>Learning German was a key part of my experience living and working in Germany for 3 months during my summer internship in Berlin in 2019. I had recently finished my 4th semester of German at Indiana University ahead of this experience, and it was wonderful being able to speak with people in Germany, even though I definitely had room to improve. I had been to a few other countries prior to 2019, my family would travel to other countries often when I was growing up. However I really caught the travel "bug" after that summer in Berlin, and felt a desire to see more of the world when I get opportunities to do so.

										<h3>Cooking</h3>

										<figcaption align= "center"><em>My family and I attending a cooking class in Italy, 2016</em></figcaption>
									</figure>
									<p>Part of my interest in travel stems from my enjoyment of cuisine from different places in the world. I love to try new food, and believe this is a meaningful way of experiencing other cultures. I also like to learn how to cook new meals, and I gain immense satisfaction when I am able to authentically re-create a dish that is either difficult, or is one that I haven't had much experience with before. Similar to my love for music, I thoroughly enjoy the process that goes into cooking a meal, and improving my skills in this aspect.
									</p>

									<header>
										<h3>Movies, T.V. Series, Books and Video Games</h3>
									</header>
									<p>I am an unabashed nerd when it comes to anything science fiction. I love diving deep into a created world and discovering what oddities another person imagined might exist in a fictional universe. While attending IU when Game of Thrones was still airing, I was enthralled by the world building and character development that George R. R. Martin had done for his "Song of Ice and Fire" book series and TV adaptation. After reading a few of the books, I also began listening to the audio books of the "Witcher" series by Andrzej Sapkowski. I developed a deep appreciation for the amount of consideration they both gave to their work, and am inspired when I find that same level of care present in other media as well.
