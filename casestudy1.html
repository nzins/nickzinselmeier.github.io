									<h1>Cyclistic Bikes<br />
									Case Study</h1>
									<p>A case study I completed as part of my Google Career Certificate: Data Analytics<br />
									program. The case is focused on a bike company, Cyclistic, that is interested<br />
									in finding ways to covert its casual customers into members.</p>

								<h2>Scenario</h2>
							</header>
							<header>
							<p>As a Junior Data Analyst working at Cyclistic, my task in this case study was to uncover ways that Cyclistic might maximize the number of annual memberships. With this being the case, it was important to find the ways in which casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Using those insights, I would then be tasked with recommending marketing strategies to the Director of Marketing at Cyclistic to convert casual riders into members. </p>
							</header>
							<header>
								<h3>About Cyclistic</h3>
							</header>
								<p>A fictional company created for this particular case study, Cyclistic is A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. </p>
								<p>In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
								</p>
								<p>Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, the Marketing Director Lily Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

								<h3>Using the 6-Step data analysis process</h3>
							</header>
								<p>This case study was the final part of the Google Career Certificate in Data Analytics program, which heavily emphasized the "Data Analysis Process." This refers to the 6 phases that Data Analysts go through in one form or another when completing their analysis on a given project. These phases are: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act.</p>
								<p>For this project, there were deliverables assigned for each of those processes, asking for a statement or summary of certain information related to each step of the process. I will be presenting the completed sections of these phases to share my work with you.
							<header>
								<h3>Step 1: Ask</h3>
								<p>Deliverable: A clear statement of the business task.</p>
							</header>
								<p>The business task for this project is to increase the amount of members by finding ways to convert casual riders into annual members. This will be done by uncovering insights about casual riders and annual members through analyzing Cyclistic's data from the past year, which will lead to developing strategies for converting casual riders into members and maximizing revenue.
								</p>
							<header>
								<h3>Step 2: Prepare</h3>
								<p>Deliverable: A description of all data sources used.</p>
							</header>
								<p>The data for this project is provided by Motivate International as sample data about a bike rental service, including information about its trips and whether or not the rider is a member or casual rider. Some years include information such as birthday, and gender, but are inconsistently reported for some years and not others.
								</p>
								<p>The data was provided in excel.csv format, month by month, for the year of 2022. I was not able to find any issues with data credibility, bias, or data integrity when I looked over the excel files after downloading them. They were provided by Motivate International as data from Divvy Bikes Chicago under <a href="https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement" target="_blank">this license</a>.
							<header>
								<h3>Step 3: Process</h3>
								<p>Deliverable: Documented steps of cleaning & manipulating datasets</p>
							</header>
								<p>The data manipulation I completed in this step involved adding two columns to the 12 csv files: ride_length, and day_of_week. Both of these were calculated fields in excel. I calculated ride length by subtracting the start_time column with the end_time column for each row in the data sets.
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/excel function ride duration.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I also calculated the day_of_week column by using the WEEKDAY command, as seen below.
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/excel function day of week.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I did notice that some rows of information were missing values, particularly the station names in some of the spreadsheets for the year of 2022. I decided not to try and correct this error, as it did not affect the primary data that I was interested in, those being the ride length, day of week, and member/casual columns.
								</p>
							<header>
								<h3>Step 4: Analyze</h3>
								<p>Deliverable: A summary of analysis performed</p>
							</header>
								<p>Using Spreadsheets, SQL, and RStudio, I was able to retrieve information about the riders and break down the analysis into relevant categories that would help inform stakeholders about differences and preferences between casual riders and members. The pivot table in particular helped significantly in viewing the data both yearly and by month, and the SQL queries I performed also contributed to my growing curiousity as I focused on different variables.
								</p>
								<article>
									<header>
									</header>
									<class="image fit"><img src="images/SQL_casualweekdaymode.PNG" alt="" />
									<class="image fit"><img src="images/SQL_memberweekdaymode.PNG" alt="" />
									<class="image fit"><img src="images/SQL_ridecount.PNG" alt="" />
									<p>After loading the .csv files into BigQuery, I ran some preliminary queries on information I was keen on learning more about.
									</p>
									<class="image fit"><img src="images/SQL_casualavgtripduration.PNG" alt="" />
									<class="image fit"><img src="images/SQL_memberavgtripduration.PNG" alt="" />
									<p>Following the queries I ran on the January data set in BigQuery, I decided it would be a good use case for a pivot table if I were to combine all of the data sets into one sheet for all of 2022.
									</p>
									<class="image fit"><img src="images/pivottablebig.PNG" alt="" width=100% />
									<p>I was successful in combining all the data sets in one spreadsheet, which all together had over 5 million data entries! In the pivot table, I had the day of week variable as well as the values appear in the columns. Numbers 1-7 pertaining to the days of the week starting with Sunday-Saturday.
									</p>
									<class="image fit"><img src="images/pivottablemonths.PNG" alt=""width=100% />
									<p>In the picture above, you can see that I was aso able to filter the table by month, as well as the ability to select the entire year. From looking through this pivot table by each month as well as the year overall, I was able to quickly see some basic trends, such as members tend to ride shorter durations than casual users, and there are more member rides throughout the year overall compared to casual riders.
									</p>
									<p>Having these basic notions of what was going on in the data set would begin how I would start to think about vizualizing the data for the next step...
									</p>
								</article>
							<header>
								<h3>Step 5: Share</h3>
								<p>Deliverable: Supporting visualizations and key findings.</p>
							</header>
								<p>After realizing how helpful it would be to have a monthly view for casual and member riders for the year of 2022, I decided to create a Tableau dashboard which would give a breakdown of the average number of riders by weekday for each month. I knew that creating a dashboard with 12 elements would be challenging to keep things easy to understand, so I kept the visualization as minimal as possible wtih this in mind.
								</p>
								<p>If you are interested, I recommend going fullscreen with the embedded Tableau visualization below by clicking the icon in the bottom right of the table and hovering over the elements to learn more about the data set.
								</p>

								</div>
							</article>
								<p>Although there are many elements in the viz above, it helps display the seasonal trends for members and casual riders, as well as painting a picture of the differences of weekly patterns between members & casual riders. For example: on average, casual users tend to use Cyclistic more often on the weekends, whereas annual members use Cyclistic primarily during the workweek. This may suggest that annual members might be using Cyclistic as part of their work commute, while casual users tend to use the service on the weekends, and may not see the benefit of becoming a full member if they are only using the service a couple days per week.
								</p>
								<p>I knew it may also be helpful to have a vizualization to select one month at a time, so I altered the first dashboard and created a selectable menu for month. My only regret with this vizualization is that despite my attempts researching options for this visualization, I was not able to find a way to select multiple months at once. Still, the viz below shows a much better "up close" view by month in case stakeholders are interested in that information.

							</article>
								<p>Finally, I created a dashboard with the aim of condensing this information, and providing an overview of trends throughout the year. The dashboard below shows yearly trends of ride duration, and number of rides, bringing all the data from 2022 in one place, focusing on the two main areas of interest.

							</article>
							<p>After viewing these dashboards, they further reinforced the notion that members may be using Cyclistic as a means for their work commute, as the values of ride duration are very consistent year round, and number of rides almost always increases during the work week for members.
							</p>
							<p>I also understood after viewing my dashboards that usage surges during the summer months, which is a prime opportunity for the marketing department at Cyclistic to implement strategies focused on converting casual users into annual members, as per the business objective.
							</p>
							<header>
								<h3>Step 6: Act</h3>
								<p>Deliverable: Top three recommendations based on the analysis conducted.</p>
							</header>
								<p>After viewing the data using the tools at my disposal - first with SQL reports, then in a pivot table, and finally in Tableau - it was clear there are oppotunities for Cyclistic to implement strategies focused on attaining new annual members.
								</p>
								<dl>
									<dt>Recommendation 1</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>First among my recommendations is that Cyclistic should consider awareness marketing strategies aimed at existing casual riders, as there is a good amount of casual riders year round that stays proportional to the amount of members for each month, even when accounting for seasonal differences. It is my belief that there exists a small portion of casual riders that would benefit from converting to a membership if they were made more aware of the positive aspects of membership with Cyclistic.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Recommendation 2</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>My second recommendation is considering incentives during the most active months in the year, those being Spring and Summer months. This is a time when usage surges both for members and casual riders, and is a time when new users are trying the service for the first time. This is an opportunity to capture new users interest in Cyclistic's membership program by offering an incentive, perhaps a discounted membership fee for a determined amount of time.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Recommendation 3</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>The last recommendation I have is related to the weekly usage differences between casual and annual members. Cyclistic should consider implementing some variation of a membership that aims to capture the weekend casual riders, as the weekend is by far the most active time each week that casual riders use the service.</p>
									</dd>
								</dl>
							<header>
								<h3>Conlusion</h3>
							</header>
								<p>I thoroughly enjoyed working through this case study. As I initially viewed the excel.csv files from the data set, I recall wondering how on earth would I be able to conduct an analysis on the data set to answer the questions posed by the case study. The data that was present in the excel files seemed very surface level, and I was unsure if I would be able to achieve success finding trends within the data. After thinking about the data as I worked on it over the span of a week, the various processes I went through shaped how the analysis would eventually turn out, and I gained confidence in finding trends and uncovering insights that would eventually lead to my recommendations.
								</p>
								<p>Going from a state of uncertainty to one of understanding reinforced a notion that I have experienced before in similar circumstances - If you find yourself unsure where to start, or unsure of what to do, the best thing you can do is begin with processes that are familiar to you, and start by performing basic tasks that get the ball rolling. I experienced this in this case study by loading up the data with SQL in BigQuery, and doing basic select statements until I was familiar with how the data was structured, and began to see where I would like more information on certain topics. This turned into curiosity as I began wanting to know more about the differences between the two user groups in question. I eventually reached the point where I was finding myself asking questions about how some data entries were related, and then figuring out how to write queries that would return the information I was interested in.
								</p>
								<p>I hope you were able to follow my thought process as I worked through the 6 steps of the process set forth by the Google Career Certificate in Analytics program. Thank you very much for examining my work with this case study!
